                    <h3>Five Facts to Help you understand Sea Ice </h3>
                    <p>Sea ice plays an imortant role in regulation our climate. Sea ice acts as a “blanket,” separating the ocean from the atmosphere, according to Tilling. In addition to keeping sunlight out, sea ice traps existing heat in the ocean, keeping it from warming the air above.
                        “The ability of the ice to keep heat in the ocean depends not only on its extent, but also on its thickness,” Tilling said.
                        Every year, some ice survives the summer melt. Once winter hits, more water freezes and it becomes thicker and ......

                    <h3>Icy 'Glue' May Control Pace of Antartica Ice-Shelf Breakup</h3>
                    <p>Climate warming is the underlying cause for this change of ice-shelf behavior, because it has raised the temperatures of both the air above and the ocean water beneath the glaciers. But the way the ice shelves are responding to warming is not fully understood. Scientists have suggested that freeze-and-thaw cycles of meltwater pooling on top of the ice are making the rifts grow. But if that’s the case, how could Larsen C release its giant iceberg in winter, when the ice had been frozen solid for months?
                        To answer that question, the JPL and UC Irvine researchers focused on mélange. This messy, chunky mixture has natural properties similar to glue or grout, filling cracks or gaps and sticking to ice and rock......</p>

                    <h3>Study Projects a Surge in Coastal Flooding, Stating in 2030's  </h3>
                    <p>In half of the Moon’s 18.6-year cycle, Earth’s regular daily tides are suppressed: High tides are lower than normal, and low tides are higher than normal. In the other half of the cycle, tides are amplified: High tides get higher, and low tides get lower. Global sea level rise pushes high tides in only one direction – higher. So half of the 18.6-year lunar cycle counteracts the effect of sea level rise on high tides, and the other half increases the effect.

                        The Moon is in the tide-amplifying part of its cycle now. However, along most U.S. coastlines, sea levels have not risen so much that even with this lunar assist, high tides regularly top flooding thresholds. It will be a different story the next time the cycle comes around to amplify tides again, in the mid-2030s.....</p>

                    <h3>Locals Lockdowns Broght Fast Global Ozone Reductions, NASA Finds </h3>
                    <p>When the world went into lockdown, scientists had an unprecedented opportunity to study how human activity interacts with natural Earth system processes at regional and global scales. A team of international researchers led by JPL scientist Kazuyuki Miyazaki used this opportunity to research the two main oxides of nitrogen: nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide, collectively called NOx. They charted the chain of events from reduced fossil fuel burning during lockdowns to reduced local NOx emissions and finally to reduced global tropospheric ozone pollution. The more stringent the lockdown a nation imposed, the greater the reduction in emissions</p>

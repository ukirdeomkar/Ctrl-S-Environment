# Ctrl-S-Environment | HackThisFall 2.0

Climate change has always been neglected in our society. 
Climate change , if unchecked , is an urgent threat to health , food supplies , biodiversity  and livelihood across the globe. Earth's climate is always changing. There have been times when Earth's climate has been warmer than it is now. There have been times when it has been cooler. These times can last thousands or millions of years. People who study Earth see that Earth's climate is getting warmer. Earth's temperature has gone up about one degree Fahrenheit in the last 100 years. This may not seem like much. But small changes in Earth's temperature can have big effects.Climate change has a lead to a chaotic condition in environment by leadingto extinction of various animal species...
Nowadays climate change isn’t  just a environmental issue its a technology , food , water ,  population issue !!! So it must be solved AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE


## What it does
Ctrl+S Environment is an web application that helps in creating awareness among its user by providing real time data about Carbon emission , Ozone layer and Temperature conditions .
The Webapp helps people to gain strong fundamentals about climate change by making them understand and explain them the physical nature of Global Climate Change.
The Map section provides map about carbon emissions , ozone layer data and temperature .
The Article section contains  articles that provide practical knowledge on global climate change
The Facts sections contains informative facts about about climate change
The Views sections allows users to share their views about climate change and in this way they can also see others people’s view.


## How we built it
We started with the idea focused to create an hack for climate change .
We came to the realization that human induced climate change has contributed to extreme weather conditions across the globe .
Merging technology with climate change was one of our major focus .So, we came up with techie name :
 Ctrl+S Environment

We used HTML, CSS and JS to build the basic body of the webapp.For database we have used PHP nd MYSQL .We tried the Windy API to get realtime maps that provides information related to carbon emissions , temperature and various other factor.



## Challenges we ran into

We actually misinterprated the time as 11 AM IST for 11PM IST , So as a matter of fact we only had 36 hours left  for completing this hackathon . There were problems in integrating with the APIs used as it was our very first time using APIs. These hurdles took a lot of time and hence it was exhausting to find a bug after that. Moreover, one of our team members was vaccinated during the duration of hackathon and hence was suffering from a high temperature :)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing the project in time, learning how to use APIs on a webapp, and to have learnt a huge deal in just 24 hours.
